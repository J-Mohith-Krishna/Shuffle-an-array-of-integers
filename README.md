# Shuffle-an-array-of-integers
## Description-
This program randomly shuffles an array of integers using the Fisher-Yates algorithm. It first initializes an array of integers from 1 to 10, prints the original array, shuffles the array using the shuffleArray method, and then prints the shuffled array.
## Explanation-
  -Imports: Necessary classes for array manipulation and random number generation are imported.

  -Main Class and Method: The main class ArrayShuffler with the main method as the entry point is defined.

  -Array Initialization: An array of integers from 1 to 10 is initialized.

  -Print Original Array: The original array is printed to the console.

  -Array Shuffling: The shuffleArray method is called to shuffle the array.

  -Print Shuffled Array: The shuffled array is printed to the console.

  -ShuffleArray Method: This method shuffles the elements of the input array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm, ensuring randomness.
